		<p>OliCyber.stats is a platform that was created to provide essential but reliable statistics on the progress of the 
            national competitions of the Italian CyberSecurity Olympics. 
            The data are collected during the entire duration of the various tenders and contain all the information 
            available to the staff of the Olympics tutors.
            The OliCyber tutors are not related to the creation of this platform, as it was created by
            Tiziano Caruana and Marco Pellero as an open source project.
